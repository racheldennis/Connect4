<h1>About Connect 4</h1>	
When we were younger Connect 4 was a game that all of us would play and there are many memories we have with this game personally. We learned how to work as a team for our first hackathon and contribute evenly to our project. We used our previous knowledge in C# programming that we learned in our ICS4U course. We used the skills we learned to create a program that involves methods, double arrays, and many more aspects of C#. Some challenges we faced were using the Windows Form part of the program and also having some difficulties with some syntax errors.
